# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
I feel fairly confident with the comparison operators, but I would like more practice with strict comparison and "loose" comparison in practical excercises with strings / non number forms.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
Confident! Logical operators feel fairly natural for me to consider things by, even if the phrasing gets weird when you start speaking in terms of what things are NOT.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
Quite confident, what little experience i have with javascript put me in contact with if / elif / else statements and how to use them in a general sense.
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
I spent about 1 hour on this excercise, not counting the time to record the video and post it to my small group channel.
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I need to practice the commands on the mac versus the commands I had gotten used to with my own PC for the past months. So far, I am accumulating that understanding in a fairly comfortable pace.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
I am wondering how the pace of Mod 0 so far compares to the pace of Mod 1, and Turing in general. If this is a good representation of the pace for Mod 1, I know I need to get my routine and sleep schedule more organized so I can get consistent performance out of my brain on a daily basis. 

I am not feeling too overwhelmed, but aware that I am not in the best "mental shape" that I could be for this week and I want to feel more confident in getting my brain to do tough stuff on demand. 

To get the answers I need, I just need to stay curious and hungry for the process that we are in. I know to look to google for help, my classmates, or my instructors when I feel lost.
